This is a project within the course DD2488 Compiler Construction at Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm (KTH). In short it is a compiler for the language KOOL (a recursive acronym which stands for "KOOL Object-Oriented Language") which is a limited programming language, the languague specification is available at http://www.csc.kth.se/~phaller/compilers/labs/labs2.html. We have made our own lexer and parser, performed name analysis and typechecking before generating code for the Java Virtual Machine. The compiler is written in Scala.
